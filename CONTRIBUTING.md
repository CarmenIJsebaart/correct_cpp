## My correct code is rejected, but should be accepted

If you think this project would improve by accepting your correct code,
you can help improve it by submitting a Pull Request on the `develop` branch. 

Your `main.cpp` must be put in the chapter's name folder and renamed to `accept_[number].cpp`, 
where `[number]` should be a number. 

If your correct code is accepted, this will break this project's build.

The maintainers of this project will take a look at your code.

If the code is found correct indeed, your code will be accepted and a fix will be added. 

If the code is found incorrect, your code will be rejected. Sorry!

## My incorrect non-evil code is accepted, but should be rejected

If you think this project would improve by rejecting your non-evil code,
you can help improve it by submitting a Pull Request on the `develop` branch. 

Your `main.cpp` must be put in the chapter's name folder and renamed to `reject_[number].cpp`, 
where `[number]` should be a number. 

If your incorrect non-evil code is accepted, this will break this project's build.

The maintainers of this project will take a look at your code.

If the code is found non-evil indeed, your code will be accepted and a fix will be added. 

If the code is found evil, your code will be rejected. Sorry!
