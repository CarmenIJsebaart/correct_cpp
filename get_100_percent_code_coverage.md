# How to get a 100% code coverage?

In all chapters your code coverage needs to be 100%.

## Achieving 100% code coverage is easy

Already your first code must have 100% code coverage. For the first chapters, this is easy. Here is the solution for the first chapter:

```c++
int main() {}
```

Code coverage is 100%, as all (zero) lines of code are used.

## Losing 100% code coverage by doing something needlessly complex

Here is an example that does not have 100% code coverage:

```c++
int main() 
{
  if (1 + 1 == 3)
  {
    //Line that is never executed
  }
}
```

This course will correct you if you write such code. If for the first simple exercises you do not get 100% code coverage, you did something needlessly complex.

## Achieve 100% code coverage by testing `main`

Here is an example that does not have 100% code coverage:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char*[]) 
{
  if (argc == 1)
  {
    std::cout << "Program called without arguments\n";
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "Program called with arguments\n";
  }
}
```

To achieve 100% code coverage, put the content of `main` in another function, and test that function:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

int do_main(const int argc) noexcept
{
  if (argc == 1)
  {
    std::cout << "Program called without arguments\n";
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "Program called with arguments\n";
  }
  return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char*[]) 
{
  assert(do_main(1) == 1);
  assert(do_main(2) == 1);
  return do_main(argc);
}
```

In debug mode, the `assert`s ensure all code is run.
In release mode, the `assert`s are removed, and the program runs cleanly.

The tests do produce output when correct. A test that passes should produce no output. This can be done by only testing the logic:

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>

std::string get_text(const int argc) noexcept
{
  if (argc == 1)
  {
    return "Program called without arguments";
  }
  else
  {
    return "Program called with arguments";
  }
}

int do_main(const int argc) noexcept
{
  std::cout << get_text(argc) << '\n';
  return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char*[]) 
{
  assert(get_text(1) != get_text(2));
  return do_main(argc);
}
```

As a bonus, the tests are now actually doing something useful.
