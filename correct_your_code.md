# Correct your code

There are two ways to correct your code:

 * [Do a pull request](do_a_pull_request.md)
    * No need for a Travis CI account
    * Pull requests must be created
    * Pull requests will be rejected
 * [Correct your GitHub](correct_your_github.md)
    * Need to create a Travis CI account (which is free/gratis)
    * Travis CI works on your GitHub
    * You can [use the scoreboard](use_the_scoreboard.md)
