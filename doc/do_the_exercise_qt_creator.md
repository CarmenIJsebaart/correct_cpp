# Do the exercise using Qt Creator

You can [do the exercise](do_the_exercise.md) using Qt Creator.

Each chapter uses [the same Qt Creator project file with the name `main.pro`](../shared/main.pro). 

You can:

 * In your browser, open [the main.pro file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richelbilderbeek/correct_cpp/master/shared/main.pro). Use 'save as' to save it in the chapter's folder  
 * From a terminal, in the folder of the chapter, use `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richelbilderbeek/correct_cpp/master/shared/main.pro` to download it

Open that project file using Qt Creator.

Qt Creator will show you its first screen.

At the left, in the 'Project' section, click the drop-down arrow to view the first sections of the project.
Then click the drop-down arrow on 'Sources' to view the source files. Double-click on `main.cpp` to start editing.
