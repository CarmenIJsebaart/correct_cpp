## How does this course work?

See [how this course works](how_this_course_works.md).

## Where are the teaching materials?

There is plenty of material about C++ online, which you'll have to find and use.

Recommended online resources are:

 * [isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/): excellent starting point
 * [C++ core guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines): guidelines to write correct code
 * [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/): C++ tutorials
 * [cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp): C++ reference

## Do I need a GitHub account?

Yes. These are free/gratis.

## Do I need a Travis CI account?

No. Correcting exercised will be done by my Travis CI account.

## My code just works, but is not accepted

'it just works' is not good enough for this course.
Your code will be corrected in many ways.
For example, your code will compiled with maximum warning levels.

## My incorrect code is accepted

Sure, in your code you can disable all warnings and do all
other evil things. The tools protect against Murphy, not against Machiavelli.

If you think you code should have been rejected, consider sending the example
code to the developers of those tools.

## Why the name of the course?

'correct' is meant to have the same meaning as 'cannot-be-corrected'.
A solution is correct, if it cannot be corrected by tools.
If these tools cannot detect a flaw, the solution 
is called correct. This does not mean a human may see
imperfections in these solutions.
