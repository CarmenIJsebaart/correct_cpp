## Why the name of the course?

'correct' is meant to have the same meaning as 'cannot-be-corrected'.
A solution is correct, if it cannot be corrected by tools.
If these tools cannot detect a flaw, the solution 
is called correct. This does not mean a human may see
imperfections in these solutions.
