# FAQ

## How does this course work?

See [how this course works](how_this_course_works.md).

## Do I need a GitHub account?

Yes. These are free (as in beer).

## Do I need a Travis CI account?

No. Correcting exercised will be done by my Travis CI account.

## Why the name of the course?

'correct' is meant to have the same meaning as 'cannot-be-corrected'.
A solution is correct, if it cannot be corrected by tools.
Each solution is checked by tools, not by humans.
If these tools cannot detect a flaw, the solution cannot be
corrected, and is -in this context- called 'correct'. 

In this way, 'correct' does not mean 'perfect'.
