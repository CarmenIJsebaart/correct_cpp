# Push your code 

After having done the exercise, push your code to let `git` upload your proposed solution.

On your local computer, use `git push` from the command-line to upload your code.
Before this, you also need to add and commit your proposed changes.

For example:

```
git add --all :/
git commit -m "My proposed changes"
git push
```
