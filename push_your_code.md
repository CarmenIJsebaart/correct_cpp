# Push your code 

After having [done the exercise](do_the_exercise.md), [push your code](push_your_code.md) to let `git` upload your proposed solution.

On your local computer, use `git push` from the command-line to upload your code.
Before this, you also need to add and commit your proposed changes.

For example:

```
git add --all :/
git commit -m "My proposed changes"
git push
```

Your code is now uploaded to your GitHub, where you can now [do a pull request](do_a_pull_request.md).
