# Do a pull request

After [pushing your code](push_your_code.md), there are two ways to [correct your code](correct_your_code.md).

[do a pull request](do_a_pull_request.md) is the way that features:

  * No need for a Travis CI account
  * Pull requests must be created
  * Pull requests will be rejected

On your fork's GitHub page, click on `Pull request`, which is directly 
below the green `Clone or download` button.

One the chapter's (*not* your fork's) GitHub, at Pull Requests (directly
below the GitHub's title) you can see how well your code did. 

If you are quick, Travis CI is not even detected your pull request:

After Travis CI notices your pull request, it will correct your work:

If there was something corrected, the pull request will fail. Click on the Travis CI icon to view the Travis CI log to find the correction.

If your solution was correct, the build status of your pull request will become green. Your code will be rejected 
with a :+1: (this is a course, remember?).
