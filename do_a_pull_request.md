# Do a pull request

After [pushing your code](push_your_code.md), [do a pull request](do_a_pull_request.md) to correct your solution.

On your fork's GitHub page, click on `Pull request`, which is directly 
below the green `Clone or download` button.

One the chapter's (*not* your fork's) GitHub, at Pull Requests (directly
below the GitHub's title) you can see how well your code did. 

If your solution was correct, the build status of your pull request will
become green, red otherwise.

Your code will be rejected if it contains a solution (this is a course, remember?).
If your Pull Request improves the (text of the) chapter, 
your suggestions are merged after a positive review.
